# Project Brief: Dynamic API Gateway

## Project Overview
A secure, production-ready API gateway server that acts as an intermediary between client applications and various backend APIs. The gateway provides centralized security, rate limiting, logging, and request forwarding capabilities.

## Core Requirements
- **Security First**: API key authentication, HTTPS enforcement, domain whitelisting
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request limits per IP/domain combination
- **Request Forwarding**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods
- **SSL Support**: Configurable SSL certificate handling including self-signed certs
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging to console and files
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and configuration endpoints
- **Admin Interface**: Web-based admin UI for monitoring and configuration

## Project Goals
1. **Security**: Protect backend APIs from unauthorized access and abuse
2. **Reliability**: Ensure stable API communication with proper error handling
3. **Observability**: Provide detailed logging and monitoring capabilities
4. **Flexibility**: Support multiple backend APIs with different configurations
5. **Performance**: Efficient request routing with connection pooling

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Secure request forwarding with authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ Domain whitelisting blocks unauthorized endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- ✅ Health checks for operational monitoring
- ✅ SSL certificate flexibility for different environments
- ✅ Admin endpoints for configuration management

## Non-Goals
- Complex routing rules or transformations
- User authentication/authorization beyond API keys
- Caching or response modification
- Load balancing across multiple backend instances
- Advanced analytics or metrics collection

## Target Environment
- Node.js runtime (v16+)
- Production and development configurations
- Docker container deployment ready
- Vercel deployment compatible
